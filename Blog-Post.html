        <strong>What is SharePoint?</strong>
       <blockquote><p>
          Microsoft SharePoint is a web-based collaborative platform that
          integrates with Microsoft Office, Launched in 2001. SharePoint isn’t a
          programme it’s a platform and it’s a collection of many very different
          products and technologies all wrapped up and given a name
          “SharePoint”.
        </p>
        <p>
          SharePoint is a server product we don’t install SharePoint on our
          laptop or desktop because its installed on our back-end system and
          shared across network. There are some associated programs that can
          install on our desktop like SharePoint designer and SharePoint
          workspace.
        </p>

      <strong>What are the areas of the SharePoint ?</strong>
       <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Sites</strong>– SharePoint makes websites, the best part of
            this we don’t need any special programs and be a Web designer or
            programmer to make sites. <br />
            <figure>
              <img
                class="figures"
                src="images\SharePoint Site.jpg"
                alt="SharePoint Site Example"
              />
              <figcaption>Fig.1 - SharePoint Site</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <b>Example: </b>We can create websites for our self or for our team,
            our company. <br />
            We might create websites or we might use SharePoint sites other
            people have made. We can create and edit pages.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Communities</strong>– SharePoint helps working with other
            people.<br />
            <figure>
              <img
                class="figures"
                src="images\SharePoint Community.jpg"
                alt="SharePoint Community"
              />
              <figcaption>Fig.2 - Example of SharePoint Community</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <strong> Example:</strong> If I and one other person working on the
            word document same time, SharePoint can let me do this. If I want a
            Wikipedia editable by hundred people, SharePoint can do it too.<br />It
            can give us shared calendars, shared tasks, shared discussion
            boards.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Content</strong>– SharePoint gives us a place to our content
            and stuffs instead of saving it in a local folders or shared drive.
            We can put it all in SharePoint.<br />
            <figure>
              <img
                class="figures"
                src="images\SharePoint Contents.jpg"
                alt="SharePoint Site Contents"
              />
              <figcaption>Fig.3 - SharePoint Site Contents</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <strong>Example:</strong> We can create SharePoint List as a
            database for our PowerApps application.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Search-</strong> SharePoint also provide search engine to
            search our contents and stuffs. It’s a massive search engine that
            does not allow us to search only our own content but also it will
            let us search people and this will be done so securely that no can
            access to anything they shouldn’t.
            <figure>
              <img
                class="figures"
                src="images\SharePoint-Search.jpg"
                alt="SharePoint Search"
              />
              <figcaption>Fig.4 - SharePoint Search</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Insights-</strong> SharePoint helps us to bring all the
            information and data together and not just it brings together but it
            brings together to understand it better to organise, make sense
            amounts of contents taking different kind of things like
            spreadsheets, business, blogs and business Intelligence system and
            presenting in way like dashboards, scorecards and visual diagrams
            that automatically updated in the real time with information inside
            the SharePoint.<br />As a SharePoint developer, we are paid to use
            my brain not to do manual labour and that means I have to take
            decisions by this insights.
            <figure>
              <img
                class="figures"
                src="images\SharePoint-Insights.jpg"
                alt="SharePoint Composites"
              />
              <figcaption>Fig.5 - SharePoint Insights</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Composites-</strong> No platform, no program, no Operating
            System can know exactly what we need, so SharePoint has capabilities
            to be extended. The best part of this, we don’t need to be a
            programmer. Using SharePoint designer and Visio we can build custom
            workflows and forms without codes and if we do know code, we can do
            more things.
