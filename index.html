          <blockquote>
            <strong>There are 15 ways to search on google. We can search anything on
            Google like lyrics of the song, food recipe, etc. Also, it is the
            key source for learning for the students.<br />
            <br />
            The 15 ways are following it could be either this or that-</strong>
          </blockquote>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Sometimes we’re not sure that we’ve correctly remember the
              information or the name we need.</strong
            ><br />
            So, just put some couple of variation of what you are looking for
            and Separate them by Vertical bar symbol ( <strong>∣</strong> ). And
            instead of this symbol you can also use the “or” between the
            variation. <br /><strong>Example</strong>– suppose you friend
            mention wants same hair cut as Bruce but he didn’t mention either
            “Bruce Banner” or “Bruce Wayne” so we’ll search on google
            <strong
              ><em>“Hair style of Bruce Banner or Bruce Wayne” </em></strong
            ><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Searching using Synonyms</strong>.<br />When you want to
            find websites on a given subject rather than those that include a
            specific phrase, add the tilde(<strong>∼</strong>) to your search.
            <br /><strong>Example- </strong>If you search for the
            <strong>“<em>Healthy ∼ Food</em> ”</strong>, you will get the
            results about the principle of healthy eating, cooking recipes as
            well as healthy dining option. It helps you to find your desired
            result without typing many times.<br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Searching within website</strong><br />Sometimes you read an
            interesting article and want to share with your friends, or you want
            to read it again. The easiest way to find, type the web site and
            then a keyword or the entire phrase from the article.<br /><strong
              >Example- </strong
            >Suppose, I read about an update of android in Wikipedia. So, I will
            search “<strong><em>Wikipedia.com Android update</em></strong
            >” .<br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The power of the asterisk(*)</strong><br />
            When you forget to remember that one keyword phrase or number, we
            need to find what we are looking for then you can use the
            asterisk(*). Just use it in the place of word or phrase you forget,
            and you should be able to find the results you are looking.
            <br /><strong>Example- &nbsp;</strong>Suppose you forget science
            fiction (i.e. 11.63) and you think that it was 11.22 but not sure
            about that. So, just type “<strong><em>11.22*</em></strong
            >” and Google will find whole thing for you.<br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>When lots of words are missing</strong>.<br />If it’s the
            lengthier half of the phrase you can’t remember rather than a single
            keyword, try writing the first and last word and putting “
            <strong
              >Around + (the approximate number of phrase) + the keyword</strong
            >”<br /><strong>Example- </strong>Suppose you read a poem describing
            someone wandering as a cloud and forget the poet’s name. so, you
            need to search “<strong
              ><em>I was wandering AROUND(5) cloud</em></strong
            >”<br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Using a number range.</strong><br />Sometimes we need to get
            the list of events that occurred during a certain period of time. To
            do so just add a time frame to your search query with the help of
            three dotes(<strong>…</strong>)<br /><strong>Example-</strong> If
            you want to know about the scientific discoveries during 20<sup
              >th</sup
            >
            century. You can search “<strong
              ><em>Scientific discoveries 1900…2000</em></strong
            >”<br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Searching for a title or URL</strong><br />To help finds
            keyword and name of an article just type
            <strong>“intitle:the phrase you want to search” </strong>and to
            search in the URL<strong>
              “inurl:the keyword you want to search”</strong
            ><br /><strong><em>*Note- </em></strong
            ><em
              >It is important to make no spaces between words and
              punctuation.</em
            ><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Finding similar websites</strong><br />If you find something
            you really like online and want to find similar website. Just type
            <strong>“related:www.apple.com” </strong><br /><strong
              ><em>*Note- </em></strong
            ><em
              >It is important to make no spaces between words and
              punctuation.</em
            ><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Whole phrases</strong><br />Framing the search term within
            quotation marks is the simplest and most effective way to find
            something specific and in the exact order you type in it.
            <br /><strong>Example-</strong> If you type in the some words like
            song lyrics <strong>without quotation</strong> mark the search
            engine will show the results where those words appear in any order
            on a website, not in the specific order in which you type. However,
            if you type that words in <strong>quotation</strong> marks, you’ll
            only get results where those words appear only in the order you type
            them.<br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unimportant Search Words</strong><br />To remove unimportant
            words from, your query just simply write a minus symbol before each
            one.<br /><strong>Example</strong>– If you are looking for any
            interesting book but you don’t want to buy simply type
            <strong><em>“Interesting Book -Buy”</em></strong
            ><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Searching images using images</strong><br />Suppose you were
            browsing the internet and suddenly saw the picture of the most
            beautiful cloth ever or maybe your friend posted a pic from a
            wonderful café and didn’t mention place to keep it secret. Google
            can solve both of these, you just need to save those images and hit
            the camera button on Google images and attach that picture or its
            URL. Google will then find similar images on the web.<br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Defining words and learning where they came from</strong
            ><br />Any language including English is constantly developing so
            new words appear and old words become history. Google will help you
            find them easily. Just type that word and put a semi-colon after
            this without space.<br /><strong>Example- </strong>If I want to know
            where the word “Define” came from. I would type
            <strong><em>“Define:” </em></strong><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Finding a specific file</strong><br />Sometimes you exactly
            know what you need and in what shape you wanted. Maybe you have seen
            a great pdf or PowerPoint online, and now you need it again. Google
            will help you.<br /><strong>Example- </strong>if you want to find a
            colourful pdf on cat breeds type
            <strong><em>“ Cat Breeds filetype: pdf ”</em></strong
            ><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Using Google as a spell checker</strong><br />This is basic
            and simple, but it is very useful. Google offers the correct way to
            spell words when you make a mistake by accident. If you are not sure
            how to write this or that word, try typing it in search query.
            Google will help you out. You just need to use the word in a word
            combination for a better result.<br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tracking your packages</strong><br />It can also help you
            track your package really quick. Instead of doing usual things and
            going to the shipping company website, just type your tracking
            number in the search query. It will work with <strong>UPS</strong>,
            <strong>USPS</strong> and <strong>FedEx</strong>.
